This is a Group Project for School, to build a Vulnerbility Scanner with python and Nmap.

The Goal is to use it and being able to show all open ports of an Host.

The Modules Nmap and Flask need to be installed:

- pip install nmap
- pip install flask

It opens a Webserver with Flask and scanns the Host of the Ip adress that is chosen and shows the open ports in it with Nmap.
It also has the function to show the IP adress of the host who runs it.
The Code of the Scanner can also be found on the webserver and has a copy function.
